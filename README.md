### Overview

Exploratory data analysis undertaken  on a ["Supermarket Sales"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) dataset taken from Kaggle. The analysis aims to uncover broad trends relating to the sales data associated with different supermarket branches and product lines. 

This project utilises exploratory data analysis conducted using SQL queries and MySQL Workbench to uncover key business insights within the superkarmet sales dataset. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The data analysis is motivated by a set of business questions that seek to identify trends relating to branch and product performance as well as customer behaviour. 

The analysis concludes with a series of revenue and profit calculations accross the three branches contained in the dataset. 

#### Sales Performance Analysis

 Which product line contributes the most to the revenue, and does this vary by branch or city?

How do sales differ by day of the week or time of day?

#### Customer Behaviour Analysis

What are the shopping patterns based on customer type (Member vs. Normal)?

Is there a gender difference in the types of products purchased or the amount spent?

What payment methods are most commonly used, and do these preferences differ by branch or product line?

#### Product Analysis

Which products have the highest and lowest sales volumes?

What is the average unit price of products sold, and how does it vary across different product lines?

Are there certain product lines that have particularly high or low ratings?

#### Profitability and Margin Analysis

What is the gross income generated by each product line, and which ones are the most profitable?

How do gross margin percentages compare across different branches?

Analyze the correlation between gross income and other factors like customer type, time of purchase, or payment method.

#### Customer Satisfaction Analysis

What is the average customer rating, and how does it vary across branches and product lines?

Is there a relationship between customer ratings and gross income or the quantity of products sold?

#### Revenue and Profit Calculations

**1. COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):**

-   Defined as the direct cost incurred from the sale of goods.
-   Calculation: Multiplying the unit price of each item by its sold quantity.
-   Formula: `COGS = Unit Price * Quantity`

**2. VAT (Value Added Tax):**

-   Represents the tax levied on the sale of goods.
-   Calculation: Determined as 5% of the COGS, reflecting the tax amount paid by the customer.
-   Formula: `VAT = 5% * COGS`

**3. Total Revenue (Gross Sales):**

-   The total billing amount to the customer, inclusive of COGS and VAT.
-   Calculation: Summation of COGS and VAT.
-   Formula: `Total Revenue = VAT + COGS`

**4. Gross Profit (Gross Income):**

-   Indicates the profitability of sales before accounting for indirect expenses.
-   Calculation: Derived by deducting COGS from the Total Revenue.
-   Formula: `Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS`

**5. Gross Margin Percentage:**

-   A profitability metric showing the Gross Profit as a percentage of Total Revenue.
-   Calculation: Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue, multiplied by 100.
-   Formula: `Gross Margin Percentage = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100`

#### Example:

For a transaction with a Unit Price of $45.79 and Quantity of 7, the calculations are as follows:

-   `COGS = $45.79 * 7 = $320.53`
-   `VAT = 5% * $320.53 = $16.0265`
-   `Total Revenue = $16.0265 + $320.53 = $336.5565`
-   `Gross Profit = $336.5565 - $320.53 = $16.0265`
-   `Gross Margin Percentage ≈ 4.7619%`
